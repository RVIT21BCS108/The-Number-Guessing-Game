The Number Guessing Game is a Python console application where users attempt to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100. The game offers two difficulty levels: 'easy' with 10 attempts and 'hard' with 5 attempts. Users are prompted to guess the number, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The number of remaining attempts is displayed after each guess. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number or runs out of attempts. This project demonstrates the use of functions, conditionals, loops, and user input handling in Python.
